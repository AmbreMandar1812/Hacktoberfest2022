## Description

Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The main target of the algorithm is to find the subset of edges by using which, we can traverse every vertex of the graph. Kruskal's algorithm follows greedy approach which finds an optimum solution at every stage instead of focusing on a global optimum.
